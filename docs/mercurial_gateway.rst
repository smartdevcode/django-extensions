:synopsis: Mercurial (hg) Repository Gateway


Introduction
------------

For people liking the Mercurial distributed version control system. I've setup
a gateway of several Django related repositories including the command
extensions. You can use these as stand alone repositories as well as in
combination with the excellent hgforest extension. Which works much like an
svn:external would. (except for that extra warm and fuzzy distributed
feeling :) )


Usage
-----

Browse the repository at:
  http://hgsvn.trbs.net/django-command-extensions/file/

Clone the repository::

  hg clone http://hgsvn.trbs.net/django-command-extensions
